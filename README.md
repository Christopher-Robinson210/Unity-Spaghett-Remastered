## Description
Save your spaghett from waves of hungry memes that are trying to eat it.

Enemy Types:
 - Pepe: Easy to deal with and only moves straight towards your spaghett.
 - Sonic: Has to go fast! Sometimes he likes to sprint around.
 - Troll: Likes to have the last laugh. Deal with it.
 - Forever Alone: Seems to live forever.
 - Ugandan Knuckles (Boss): Here to show you the way and wear out your clicker finger.
